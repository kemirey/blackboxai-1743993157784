├── dashboard.php           # Main dashboard for logged-in users
├── surat_masuk.php         # Management for incoming letters
├── surat_keluar.php        # Management for outgoing letters
├── php/                    # Directory for PHP scripts
│   ├── auth.php            # Authentication handling
│   └── db.php              # Database connection
├── partials/               # Directory for reusable components
│   └── sidebar.php         # Sidebar component included in the letter management pages
└── other-files/            # Include additional files as necessary
